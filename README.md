Comments to Evaluators:<br/>

  I was sick the first week of school, so I had to play catch up this week.  Sorry my website is pretty simple, I am extremely new<br/>
  to this field of CS. I think I did everything that was asked of me, but I am not 100% sure :^).<br/>

Assignment Specific Write-up:<br/>

  I didn't really know what content I should put on my front page and details page so they are pretty bare bones.<br/>
  I made my website colorful and vibrant and on the opportunities page I decided to go with, in my opinion, a prettier version <br/>
  of the webpage designed in class and also included some gifs, not images to make it a little more fun.  I spent most of my<br/>
  time figuring out how to get the text to align and the tables to look good.  I honestly spent way to much time designing my<br/>
  web page and tinkering with color schemes and fonts because it was fun.  I wanted to keep the UI simple and straight forward.<br/>
  I have never done anything like this before so it was a pretty good learning experience for me.<br/>
