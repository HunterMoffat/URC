Comments to Evaluators:<br/>
I tried my best, but I couldn't get the tooltips to work properly, if you hover over the sumbmit button on the application page you can see my tooltip<br/>
but it looks really wonky<br/>


Assignment Specific Write-up:<br/>

I was surprised at how much better my website looks and how easy bootstrap is to use! The jumbotron thing made my front page actually look good.<br/>
I tried to experiment with bootstrap, but since I am a novice to web development my implementation seems a little basic, but it is now something<br/>
actually usable compared to the first assignment.  What I mean is each page feels more complete and the buttons look so much better than just <br/>
hyperlinks.  My website no longer looks like it was made in 2001 now it looks like something from at least 2015 :^).  I am acually kind of proud<br/>
of the application page.  Each field is evenly spaced out (at least on my monitor) and each field seems like something that would exist on an<br/>
official website.  The usability increased drastically in my opinion because instead of one page fully implemented, I now have a website with<br/>
links going to different pages and useful information being displayed to the user.

   Most of the assignment I tried to use the examples from lecture to structure my web pages. I also used the websites in the assignment doc as references.<br/>
