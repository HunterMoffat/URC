Comments to Evaluators:<br/>

  I made a post on piazza to why this submission is late, I was given the 'ok' to turn it in today.  I was unable to figure out the image uploading, but I did try to add some images to my opportunities anyway.  I alos did not include any extra databases because I could not figure out how to get them to work with AWS.<br/>

Assignment Specific Write-up:<br/>

  I added a new opportunities page and a new details page to my website along with a List page and other CRUD pages.  I used cards to display each opportunity and gave each seeded opportunity its own image to use because I thought it looked better than having all the same image for each one.  Any one of these images can be used as sort of a default option when creating a new opportunity on the website. They are all stored in the images folder.  As far as feedback goes,  I absolutely loved this assignment.  I thought it was really fun to program and made me more comfortable with css and html.  I did think it was a lot of work for one week and it seems like I am not the only student with that opinion, but considering how much work I actually put into this assignment I think it was an awesome learning experience for me and opened my eyes to all the possibilities for the future design of my website.  Honestly most of my time went in to trying to make the opportunities and details page look good and even though they still look amateur I am proud of it. <br/>
